# Important Files for firebase:

Try out an example app with Analytics

Like all packages, the firebase_analytics plugin comes with an example program.

    Open a Flutter app that you've already configured to use Firebase (see instructions on this page).
        This application.

    Access the lib directory of the app, then delete the existing main.dart file.
        Okay got it. Just put it in my Archived folder.

    From the Google Analytics example program repository, copy-paste the following two files into your app's lib directory:
        main.dart
        tabs_page.dart

    Run your Flutter app.

    Go to your app's Firebase project in the Firebase console, then click Analytics in the left-nav.

        - [X] Click Dashboard. If Analytics is working properly, the dashboard shows an active user in the "Users active in the last 30 minutes" panel (this might take time to populate this panel).

        - [X] Click DebugView. Enable the feature to see all the events generated by the example program.
            Finally I found DebugView: https://console.firebase.google.com/u/3/project/kidsbank-45877/analytics/app/android:com.example.wfinals_kidsbank/debugview/realtime~2Fdebugview%3Ffpn%3D545950721467
            It's the left-hand side navigation of url: https://console.firebase.google.com find the section saying Analytics. Then under Analytics it would say "Dashboard", "Realtime Analysis", "Events", etc. Go to DebugView.

For more information about setting up Analytics, visit the getting started guides for iOS+, Android, and web.

Disable debug on Analytics.
```terminal
adb shell setprop debug.firebase.analytics.app .none.
```
