# wfinals_kidsbank

A new Flutter project.

OUR MAIN REPO: https://github.com/Michael679089/CS319_Flutter-Application-Development


----

# Things Fixed so far:

1. Currently I fixed the parent-dashboard-page
2. Fixed the parent-chores-page
3. Fixed the parent-notification-page
4. Fixed the parent-setup-page
5. Made the account-selector-page for each family. 



Notifications, they are confusing.



What if: 

1. Notification if Child Withdraws money from the account.
    - Notifies Parent of the Child that withdrawed.
2. Notification if Parent Deposits to Child's Account.
    - Notifies targeted child.
3. Notification if Parent Withdraws from Child's Account.
    - Notifies targeted child.


4. If Parent and Child are at the notification page, chores page. There should be a ping noise if there's new notifications added.
